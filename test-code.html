        <h3>Irfan alam</h3>
        <p>PhD Scholar, University of Bristol, England</p>
        <p>Before enrolling at Nalanda, my exposure to the Ambedkarite movement had already made me aware of the significance of higher education. However, I lacked knowledge on the practical steps to pursue it. There was no one among my family or in the community to guide me. Coming from a family of sanitation workers, everyone expected me to join the same caste-based occupation. It was very depressing as I witnessed the indignities suffered by my family and wanted to break this vicious cycle. At one stage, I almost gave up on my dream. I was even ready to commit crimes to escape doing the sweeper's job. Somehow, I got to know about Nalanda and Anoop sir helping students to pursue higher education free of cost. It filled me with positive hope. After training from Nalanda, I went to TISS Mumbai for my Masters and now I'm studying in England. My success inspired many young students from my area, and some of them are now studying in prestigious universities. This is a remarkable achievement for my local community, which hardly had any graduates. Thank you, Nalanda!</p>
